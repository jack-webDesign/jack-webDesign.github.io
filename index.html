        <p>Everyday is a new opportunity <br><br>
        Everyday, you always encounter the <b>unexpected</b> <br><br>
        There are things you can expect or forsee <br><br>
        But, the <b>unexpected</b> always affects the forseen <br><br>
        To be prepared for the <b>unexpected</b>, what can you prepare? <br><br>
        Can you put your faith into your <b>expectations?</b> <br><br>
        Adjusting through the <b>unexpected</b> <br><br>
        But only until the <b>unexpected</b> occurs <br><br>
        Does anything ever go as planned? <br><br>
        <b>Expectations</b> should not rely on uncertainty <br><br>
        Can you adapt everyday? <br><br>
        Until you can never have <b>expections</b>
